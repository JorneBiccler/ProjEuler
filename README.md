ProjEuler

Solutions for Project Euler in R
I'm slowly adding some solutions that I made in R, I know not all my implementations are super efficient.
I update my help functions every once in while (if I need one but the problem takes to long to solve
with the current implementation). 

Notes on more efficient implementations are always welcome
